[![randommm.gif](https://s4.gifyu.com/images/randommm.gif)](https://gifyu.com/image/S9f2u)

We all know a calculator, yes, those we use in math classes, I set out to make a web version of a calculator because we don't always have a physical one in our hand. Also, look at it as one of my first projects with JS.

Last Updates:
* Design adapted for mobile devices
* NaN bug fixed
* You can only write numbers
* Red underline in input error
